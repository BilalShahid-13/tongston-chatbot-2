Entrepreneurial-Thinking is a dynamic mind-set and approach that transcends traditional
boundaries, fostering a culture of innovation, value creation, and sustainable growth across
people, organizations and governments. It encompasses people/individuals (students,
educators, intrapreneurs, entrepreneurs), organizations/institutions, governments/societies
that embody three core attributes: Value, Influence, and Profitability (VIP).

Value means the importance, worth, relevance, or usefulness of someone or something. It is
the creation and provision of meaningful solutions, products, or services that address specific
needs, challenges, or desires of a target audience. It encompasses understanding and
responding to customer pain-points, societal needs, or communal well-being. In various
contexts, it may involve customer-centric innovation, inclusive and sustainable development,
or the enhancement of overall well-being and quality of life. Value typically offers productive
capacity and leverage on time/speed, money/funds and energy/effort.

Influence means the capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or
behaviour of someone or something, or the effect itself. It refers to the ability to inspire,
mobilize, and lead others towards a shared vision or goal. It involves the capacity to create
strong partnerships, collaborations, and networks that amplify impact and reach. Influence
can be exercised by individuals, organizations, or governments to foster creativity, drive
positive transformation, and shape dynamic presences within industries, or societal levels.
Typically, influential entities are known, liked and trusted.

Profitability means the measure of someone’s or something’s assets and income/revenues
above their liabilities and expenses/costs. It is the measure of sustainable financial success or
efficient resource utilization, depending on the context. For individuals and organizations, it
involves focusing on achieving growth and financial gains through efficient management,
innovation, and market adaptation, balanced with ethical responsibility. For governments
and societies, it extends to the equitable distribution of benefits, creation of an enabling
environment for economic growth, and striving for prosperity and sustainability in a way that
leaves a lasting legacy for future generations.

Generally, a high level of development & growth enhances value: high value enhances
influence and profitability; high influence enhances value and profitability, and high
profitability enhances value and influence.

B2C (BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER) refers to the direct selling of products or services from
businesses to individual consumers – meaning the product/service giver/provider/producer is
an individual/organisation/government while the receiver/customer/client is an individual.
This model is prevalent in retail, where companies interact directly with the end-users of their
products. The focus in B2C is often on creating a user-friendly experience, understanding
consumer preferences, and marketing products that appeal to individual tastes and needs.
Examples include online shopping platforms, supermarkets, and restaurants.

B2B (BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS) describes transactions between businesses, where one business
provides products or services to another business – meaning the product/service
giver/provider/producer

is

an

individual/organisation/government

while

the

receiver/customer/client is an organisation. This can include manufacturing, wholesaling, or
providing specialized services. Unlike B2C, where the focus is on individual consumers, B2B
interactions are often more complex, involving negotiations, contracts, and ongoing
relationships. Examples of B2B include a software company providing solutions to other
businesses, or a manufacturer supplying parts to an automobile company.

material, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual) - to create a thriving and well-rounded
population. Additionally, it entails promoting socio-cultural diversity and understanding,
driving economic development to enhance the standard of living, and striving towards
achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, it involves
continuous improvements in political and governmental systems to ensure effective

B2G (BUSINESS-TO-GOVERNMENT) refers to transactions and interactions between businesses
and governmental entities – meaning the product/service giver/provider/producer is an
individual/organisation/government while the receiver/customer/client is a government. This
can include businesses providing goods, services, or expertise to various government
agencies, departments, or institutions. B2G often involves a formal bidding process,
adherence to specific regulations, and a focus on long-term contracts. Examples might
include a construction company building infrastructure for a government or a technology
firm providing security systems to a government agency.

Entrepreneurial-thinking, regardless of a person’s career, business or locality, must transcend
across its five facets, in order to impact global sustainable socio-economic development.

SUSTAINABLE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & GROWTH refers to a dynamic and
harmonious process that seamlessly synergizes three vital pillars: personal development &
growth, professional development & growth, and public development & growth. This
integration revolves around entrepreneurial-thinking people, organizations, and governments
working collaboratively to create lasting value, influence, and profitability while nurturing a
thriving and equitable society.

Sustainable socio-economic development & growth via entrepreneurial-thinking people,
organizations, and governments requires ecosystems that efficiently and effectively
integrate/leverage education, enterprise, media, and finance. These interconnected

elements play critical roles in fostering an environment conducive to collective prosperity
and positive transformation:
