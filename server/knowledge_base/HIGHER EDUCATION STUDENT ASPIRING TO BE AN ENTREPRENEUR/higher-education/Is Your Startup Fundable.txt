Is Your Startup Fundable?
Have you ever wondered what qualities investors look for in a startup to consider it fundable?
Benjamin Chong, a partner at Right Click Capital and a Co-Director of the Sydney Founder Institute,
has created a three question test to help determine your answer in the article “Three ways to test if
your startup is fundable, on BRW.
Many entrepreneurs feel their problems will be solved with funding, but being fundable is very
different from being in need of funding. Being fundable is all about your startup’s potential to attract
financing so you can grow your business. All startups need some kind of funding to survive but not all
are considered fundable.
Is your startup fundable? Read on to see what Benjamin Chong has said on the matter.


1. Are you solving a real problem?
When launching a startup, keep in mind that your company has to offer a real value to the world, or at
least a part of it, before you seek funding. Here are some questions for you to consider:
     ● What is the problem your startup is trying to solve?
     ● Is it a real problem or a perceived one?
     ● Have potential customers confirmed you’re solving a real problem?
     ● What’s the market size of the problem?
Last week, I was presented with an idea for a personal electronic device that could help when paying
for items at the cash register. While it was an interesting idea, I couldn’t see a real problem that the
device was solving.


2. Do you have a killer team?
Great minds think alike, so building your startup team is extremely important. Investors look for
teams of individuals with a combination of technical background, business skills, and industry
experience that are driven to succeed.
A great way to gain experience is by joining a startup and contributing to the success of a fledgling
business. I’ve previously employed-future entrepreneurs, who’ve added immense value to our
businesses. At the same time, they’ve gained an understanding of the frenetic pace of an early-stage
business and developed skills from financial modelling to phone sales to graphic design.


3. Are you gaining traction?
A startup with little to no traction will not pique the interest of investors. Make sure you are
establishing a solid customer base and gaining traction over time. This will help investors determine if
your startup is viable. Below are several questions that must be addressed before pushing your startup
to the next level:
     ● Do you have users or customers?
     ● Is the rate of user growth increasing?
     ● Have you been able to charge customers for your product or service?
Investors will need to see traction to determine if your startup is viable. Traction is the proof that there
is a demand for your product or service.

1. Defining what makes a startup idea fundable
Makes your startup
When it comes to startup funding, it's not always easy to tell which ideas are fundable and which ones
aren't. However, there are some key factors that can help you determine whether or not your startup
idea is likely to attract funding from investors.
One of the most important factors is the market potential of your idea. Investors want to see that your
idea has the potential to grow into a large and successful business. They'll also be looking for
evidence that there is demand for your product or service.
Another important factor is your team. Investors want to see that you have a strong team in place that
has the skills and experience necessary to make your business a success. They'll also be looking for a
team that is passionate about your idea and committed to making it a reality.
Finally, investors will also be looking at your business model and how you plan to generate revenue.
They want to see that you have a sound plan for making money and that your business is scalable.
If you can show investors that your startup idea has strong market potential, a strong team, and a
sound business model, then you stand a good chance of attracting funding. However, even the best
ideas can fail if they're not executed well, so it's also important to have a solid plan for how you'll
bring your idea to market and make it a success.


2. How to assess whether your startup idea is fundable?
When it comes to startups, there are a lot of moving parts and pieces that need to come together in
order for the business to be successful. However, before any of that can happen, you need to have a
great idea. But not just any great idea your startup idea needs to be fundable.
So, how can you assess whether or not your startup idea is fundable? Here are a few key things to
keep in mind:
1. Does your idea solve a problem?
Investors are looking for startups that are solving a problem preferably a big one. If your startup idea
doesn't solve a problem or if the problem it does solveisn't a big enough one, its going to be tough to
get funding.
2. Is there a market for your solution?
Not only do you need to be solving a problem, but there also needs to be a market for your solution.
That is, people need to actually be willing to pay for what you're offering. If there's no market for your
solution, its not going to be fundable.
3. Do you have a competitive advantage?
In order for your startup to be successful, you need to have a competitive advantage something that
sets you apart from all the other businesses out there offering similar solutions. If you don't have a
competitive advantage, its going to be tough to get funding.
4. Do you have a clear go-to market strategy?
Investors want to see that you have a clear plan for how you're going to take your product or service
to market. If you don't have a go-to-market strategy, its going to be tough to get funding.
5. Do you have a strong team in place?
Investors want to see that you have a strong team in place a team of people who are passionate about
your idea and who have the skills and experience necessary to make it happen. If you don't have a
strong team, its going to be tough to get funding.
6. Do you have a track record of success?
Investors like to see that you have a track record of success that you've been able to achieve success in
the past. If you don't have a track record of success, its going to be tough to get funding.
7. Do you have realistic financial projections?
Investors want to see that you have realistic financial projections that you know how much money you
need to raise and that you have a clear plan for how you're going to use that money. If you don't have
realistic financial projections, its going to be tough to get funding.
8. Do you have an exit strategy?
Investors want to see that you have an exit strategy that you know how and when you're going to sell
your company or take it public. If you don't have an exit strategy, its going to be tough to get funding.
If you can answer yes to all of these questions, then there's a good chance that your startup idea is
fundable. Of course, even if your idea is fundable, there's no guarantee that you'll actually get funding.
But if your ideaisn't fundable, then your chances of getting funding are slim to none.

3. The difference between a good and bad startup idea
Difference between good Difference between a good and bad Bad Startup Good and a bad startup
Difference between good and bad startup
What separates a good startup idea from a bad one? This is a question that every entrepreneur must
answer before taking the plunge and starting their own company.
There are many factors to consider when determining whether an idea is worth pursuing as a startup.
The most important factor is whether the idea can solve a problem that people care about.
A good startup idea is one that meets a need that people have. It should be something that people are
willing to pay for, and it should be unique enough to stand out from the competition.
A bad startup idea is one that doesn't solve a problem that people care about, or one that has too much
competition. It's also important to make sure that the idea is feasible and that you have the resources
to make it happen.
The best way to come up with a good startup idea is to think about problems that you yourself have
faced. What are some things that you wish existed but don't?
Another good method is to talk to people and see what kinds of problems they're facing. What are
some things that they wish were different?
Once you've identified a problem that people care about, the next step is to come up with a solution.
This is where many good ideas fail the solution must be simple and elegant.
It should be something that people can understand and use easily. Most importantly, it should be
something that people will actually pay for.
Once you have a solution, the next step is to validate your idea. This means talking to potential
customers and seeing if they're actually interested in using your product or service.
This can be done through online surveys, interviews, or even just casual conversations. If you can't
find anyone who's interested in your idea, then it's probably not worth pursuing.
If you have a good idea, but you're not sure if it's good enough to start a company, there are a few
things you can do to test it out. One option is to create a minimum viable product (MVP).
This is a prototype of your product or service that you can use to test out your idea. It doesn't have to
be perfect, but it should be good enough to give you an idea of whether people are actually interested
in what you're offering.
Another option is to join an accelerator or incubator program. These programs help startups by
providing mentorship, resources, and even funding.
This can be a great way to validate your idea and get started on the right foot.
No matter what stage startup is in, it's important to always be testing and iterating on your idea. This
way, you can make sure that you're always moving in the right direction and making progress towards
your goals.

4. Why some startups fail to get funding?
There are a lot of reasons startups fail to get funding. Here are some of the most common ones:
1. The startup idea is not fundable.
This is the most common reason startups fail to get funding. Startups need to have a fundable idea in
order to get funding from investors. A fundable idea is an idea that has the potential to generate a lot
of revenue and profit. investors are only interested in investing in ideas that have the potential to make
them a lot of money.
2. The startup team is not experienced enough.
Investors are also interested in investing in teams that have the experience and expertise to execute
their plans. If a startup team does not have the right skills and experience, investors will not be
interested in funding them.
3. The startup does not have a good business model.
Another reason why startups fail to get funding is because they do not have a good business model. A
good business model is essential in order to generate revenue and profit. investors will not invest in a
startup if they do not believe that the startup will be able to generate revenue and profit.
4. The startup does not have a good marketing strategy.
A good marketing strategy is also essential in order to generate revenue and profit. If a startup does
not have a good marketing strategy, investors will not be interested in funding them.
5. The startup does not have a good product.
Investors are also interested in investing in startups that have a good product. A good product is one
that is appealing to customers and has the potential to generate a lot of revenue and profit. If a startup
does not have a good product, investors will not be interested in funding them.

5. How to create a pitch for your startup idea?
Pitch your startup idea
The first step is to understand what investors are looking for. They want to see a potential return on
their investment, so your pitch needs to show them how your startup will make money. They're also
looking for a team that they believe in and that has the skills to execute the plan.
1. Keep it simple
Investors are busy people and they don't have time to read a long, complicated pitch. So make sure
your pitch is clear and concise. Get to the point quickly and don't try to include too much information.
2. Focus on the opportunity
Your pitch should focus on the opportunity that your startup presents. What problem are you solving?
What needs does your startup address? Why is now the right time for your startup?
3. Demonstrate traction
If you've already started to build your startup, investors will want to see evidence of traction. This
could include user numbers, revenue, partnerships, or media coverage. Showing that you already have
some momentum will make it more likely that investors will want to get involved.
4. Be realistic
Investors are looking for startups that have potential to grow quickly and generate a lot of revenue.
But they also want to see that you're being realistic in your projections. Don't try to overhype your
startup or make unrealistic promises. Be honest about the challenges you're facing and the risks
involved.
5. Have a solid team
Investors are investing in the team as much as the idea. They want to see that you have a strong team
in place with the skills and experience necessary to execute the plan. Make sure you highlight the
experience and achievements of your team members in your pitch.
6. Know your numbers
Your pitch should include financial projections that show how your startup will make money.
Investors will want to see that you have a clear understanding of your costs, revenues, and
profitability. Make sure your numbers are realistic and backed up by data.
7. Have a clear plan
Investors want to see that you have a well-thought-out plan for how you're going to achieve your
goals. What are your marketing strategies? How will you scale your business? What are the risks and
challenges involved? Having a clear plan will give investors confidence in your ability to execute.

6. What investors look for in a startup idea?
When it comes to startup funding, there are a few key things that investors look for. They want to see
a strong team with a clear vision, a product or service that has potential to be profitable, and a market
that is large enough to support the growth of the business.
The first step in determining if your startup idea is fundable is to put together a great team. This
means finding individuals with complementary skillsets and a shared passion for the business. Its also
important that the team has a clear vision for the company and can articulate it in a way that is both
convincing and exciting.
Once you have a strong team in place, the next step is to develop a product or service that has the
potential to be profitable. This means creating something that solves a problem or fills a need in the
market. It should also be something that people are willing to pay for.
Finally, you need to make sure there is a large enough market for your product or service. This means
understanding your target audience and making sure there are enough potential customers to justify
the investment.
If you can tick off all of these boxes, then you have a good chance of securing funding for your
startup. The next step is to put together a pitch deck and start reaching out to investors.


7. How to increase the chances of getting funding for your startup?
Chances of Getting Funding
If you're looking to increase the chances of getting funding for your startup, there are a few things you
can do to make yourself a more attractive investment. First, put together a strong team with
complementary skillsets and a track record of success. Second, have a clear and concise business plan
that outlines your value proposition and how you plan to generate revenue. Third, focus on building a
minimum viable product (MVP) that can be used to validate your business concept with potential
customers.
Investors want to see that you have a solid team in place before they'll consider investing in your
startup. Make sure you have a core team of co-founders and employees who complement each other's
skillsets and who have a proven track record of success. The more experience your team has in
launching and scaling successful startups, the better.
Your business plan should be clear and concise, and it should outline your value proposition and how
you plan to generate revenue. Be sure to include specific milestones and targets so investors can see
that you have a well-thought-out plan for growing your business.
Finally, focus on building an MVP that can be used to validate your business concept with potential
customers. An MVP should be able to demonstrate your key value proposition and how you plan to
generate revenue. It should also be able to show that you have a working product that customers are
willing to pay for. By launching an MVP, you'll be able to show investors that you're serious about
your business and that you have a product that people want.
By following these tips, you'll be in a much stronger position to attract funding for your startup.
Remember, investors are looking for teams with solid experience, a well-thought-out business plan,
and a working product. If you can show them that you have all of these things, you'll be much more
likely to get the funding you need to grow your business.

8. Real life examples of funded startups
Real life examples
Startups are a dime a dozen these days. In order to stand out, your startup idea must be fundable. But
how can you tell if your startup idea is fundable?
One way to find out is to look at real-life examples of startups that have been funded. By seeing what
investors are willing to put money into, you can get a better idea of what kinds of startups are
fundable.
Here are a few examples of funded startups:
1. A startup that creates a new way to make money
2. A startup that solves a problem that has never been solved before
3. A startup that has a unique product or service
4. A startup that has a team of passionate and experienced individuals
5. A startup that has a clear plan for how they will make money
If your startup idea meets one or more of the criteria above, then it may be fundable. However, it's
important to remember that even the most promising startup ideas can fail if they're not executed
properly. So, in addition to having a fundable idea, you'll also need to have a strong business plan and
team in order to succeed.

9. Advice from successful entrepreneurs on getting funding for your
startup
Advice for successful Advice from successful entrepreneurs
You've done your research, you've worked hard on your business plan, and you're confident that your
startup has what it takes to be a success. Now its time to start thinking about how to finance your new
venture.
For many entrepreneurs, the first step is to approach family and friends for investment. This can be a
great way to get started, but its not always possible or desirable to rely on personal relationships for
funding.
So what are some other options? Here are four pieces of advice from successful entrepreneurs on how
to finance your startup:
1. Consider crowdfunding
Crowdfunding has become a popular way to finance all sorts of projects in recent years, and it can be
a great option for startups as well. platforms like Kickstarter and indiegogo allow you to reach a large
number of potential investors with minimal effort.
Of course, crowdfunding is not without its risks. You'll need to create a compelling pitch and set a
realistic fundraising goal. And there's always the possibility that youwon't reach your target. But if
you do it right, crowdfunding can be a great way to get your business off the ground.
2. Apply for grants and competitions
There are a number of government grants and private competitions available for startups. These can
be a great source of funding, but the competition is often fierce.
To increase your chances of success, make sure you thoroughly research the eligibility requirements
and selection criteria for each grant or competition you apply for. And don't be afraid to reach out to
the organizers for advice they want you to win!
3. Look for angel investors
Angel investors are individuals who provide capital for startups in exchange for equity. They typically
invest smaller amounts of money than venture capitalists, but they can be a great source of funding for
early-stage businesses.
To find angel investors, start by attending startup events and networking with other entrepreneurs. You
can also search online directories like AngelList and Gust. And don't forget to reach out to your
personal network you never know who might be interested in investing in your business.
4. approach venture capitalists
If you're looking for a large amount of capital, venture capitalists may be your best bet. But getting
funding from VCs is notoriously difficult, so its important to do your homework before you start
pitching them your business idea.
Research the VC firms that have invested in businesses similar to yours, and try to identify the
partners who are most likely to be interested in your company. Then, put together a strong pitch deck
and practise your presentation until you have it down cold. Remember, VCs see hundreds of pitches
every year, so you need to make yours stand out.
Getting funding for your startup can be a challenge, but its not impossible. With a bit of hard work
and some creativity, you can find the right investors to help you take your business to the next level.
Is Your Company VC Fundable?
You might have a great idea, a functioning business model, and a stellar team – maybe even budding
profits – but VCs aren’t biting. It can be difficult to get a clear-cut “no” from an investor or reasoning
as to why your company isn’t for them.
There are many possible explanations for a lack of investor interest, but one common reason we hear
from VCs is that there is a widespread fundamental misunderstanding of what is – and what isn’t – a
VC fundable startup in the first place. Lack of success with VCs might have nothing to do with the
“goodness” of your company or team: you might just not fit the VC model.
The truth is, VC funding isn’t for everyone. In this article, we’ll walk you through how VC works and
what that means for startups, what VCs consequently look for in early-stage companies – and what to
do if you don’t fit the VC prototype.

VC 101: learn the rules to play the game
TL;DR: VCs can’t fund your company – no matter how promising – if the size of the opportunity isn’t
large enough.
VC funds range from microfunds with <1M€ of assets under management to giant crossover funds
with several billions. In a typical fund, the general partners (GPs) run the fund and make the ultimate
call on whether to invest in your company or not, and the lion’s share of fund capital comes from
limited partners (LPs). LPs are entities that manage large amounts of capital; for example insurance
companies, banks, pension funds, pooled investment funds (funds-of-funds), family offices,
government and academic institutions, and high-net-worth individuals.

LPs invest in venture capital for many reasons, for instance the potential for high returns, supporting
revolutionary innovation, and asset diversification. Compared to other asset classes, venture capital is
particularly non-liquid and risky – therefore the upside needs to be significant to incentivize
investment.

General partners try to convince limited partners that their fund will return above-market returns with
their investment thesis (their playbook for choosing investments) and their access to deals that match
the thesis. As a founder, your company should match the VC’s investment thesis – if it doesn’t fit their
focus area, the odds of investment are significantly lower. On the other hand, as a startup you want a
VC who has experience in your sector, even more so when it comes to more complex deeptech
solutions.
How VCs make money: Fund math
Typically a VC fund’s lifetime is 10 years, split into:

    ●   Initial investment period (2-3 years) – this is when the fund is actively looking for and making
        new investments.
    ●   Portfolio development period (3-5 years) – this is when the fund is focused on portfolio
        development and follow-on investments.
    ●   Exit period (2-3 years) – this is when the fund will pursue to exit ownership stakes in their
        portfolio companies.

VC firms can and often do have multiple funds at the same time, so they often raise money every 3-5
years for a new fund (if they can).
Intuitively it might seem like a great win if a VC fund invests a million and later sells their stake for
say, twenty million. After all, they’ve returned their initial investment twenty times over. But that’s
not the case: the VC model doesn’t work by making a little bit of money on a lot of deals, but instead
by a few select deals bringing in extreme outlier returns.
Here’s an example of a €50M fund to explain why that’s the case. Typically a fund of this size will
have:

    ●   €20M for initial investments. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that the fund will
        invest in 20 different companies over a 2-3 year period with an average ticket size of €1M per
        company for 10% of ownership.
    ●   €20M for potential follow-on investments. As portfolio companies go through subsequent
        funding rounds, they will issue more stock to raise more equity. Consequently, the fund’s
        share in the company will be diluted, and they’ll need to do follow-on investments to defend
        their ownership share. In practice, VCs tend to double down on the most promising
        companies instead of spreading their follow-on money evenly across their portfolio.
    ●   €10M for management fees. VC funds typically operate under a “2 and 20” fee arrangement.
        “2” refers to a yearly 2% management fee that the VC fund charges their LPs for managing
        their money – this roughly amounts to €10M during the lifetime of the fund. The management
        fee is used to cover the expenses of the fund, for example salaries, an office, travel etc. “20”
        refers to carried interest (or ‘carry’) – a 20% cut of money VCs get beyond returning the
        initial investment to their investors. It is the carry in particular that makes VC so lucrative for
        the individuals running the fund. For the purposes of this fund math illustration, we’re not
        calculating the amount of carried interest here.

These investments turn into returns through successful liquidity events, i.e. when a startup exits
through an acquisition or goes public, whether that be through an IPO, a direct listing, or a SPAC. Yet,
building a successful startup is extremely difficult – most never reach an exit. Out of the 20 example
companies above, half will go bankrupt and eight will only give modest returns. That leaves two
companies to return the fund and make a profit. These two outliers have to be the so-called ‘fund
returners’. For example, to make 3x returns, which some would consider moderate over a decade, the
fund returners would have to exit with €1.5 billion so that the fund would return €150M for its 10%
stakes.

What governs this process is the power law, meaning that the distribution of returns in venture capital
is heavily skewed – a very small percentage of startups bring a large percentage of the returns. Fund
returners make up for the losses of the other investments in the portfolio. A good example of power
law in action is Sequoia’s investment in Whatsapp, which was acquired for $22B by Facebook in
2014. For a Series A investment of $60M, Sequoia Capital got a $3B return. Although, this 50x return
pales in comparison with Y Combinator’s estimated 112,500x return on their $20,000 investment in
AirBnb – exited for $2.25B.

This is why the startup ecosystem is obsessed with companies valued upwards from €1B, i.e. unicorns
– VCs need them to survive. Every company VCs invest in has to have (in their eyes) the potential to
become a unicorn, otherwise it makes no sense for them to take a chance on them.


Besides unicorn scale, what are VCs looking for in early-stage
companies?
The power law sets clear expectations for VC funding – you need to have the potential to be a unicorn
that can single-handedly return the fund the VC is investing from. Making such predictions especially
in the early stages is to a large extent reliant on intuition, and while there is no way to see into the
future, there are certain features VCs tend to look for.

Assuming you can convince an investor that the opportunity you are pursuing is large enough, you’ll
also need to convince them that your company is the one to seize that opportunity. After all, every
opportunity comes with opportunity cost: what if another company simply does a better job at this?
According to a16z’s Managing Partner Scott Kupor, the heuristics VCs use to evaluate investment
prospects generally fall into three categories: people, product, and market.


People
#1: Attitude
While believing that you can set up a billion-euro business alone won’t help you build one, your
likelihood of getting there is significantly lower if that isn’t your goal. Investors look for people who
are somewhat delusional with their company vision, but have the skills and conviction to make that
vision a reality against overwhelming odds – a perfect mixture of “smart enough to succeed, dumb
enough to try”.

This general mindset of ambition and resolve has been well encapsulated in the five traits to look for
in a founder, outlined by Y Combinator’s Paul Graham. There are of course many other traits that
VCs look for in founders such as knowledge, EQ and IQ, integrity, adaptability, curiosity, and
leadership etc. In fact, different VCs even have their own frameworks for doing ‘founder due
diligence’, so the exact concoction of these may be VC-dependent.



#2: Team
There’s an often romanticized concept of startup founders having a lightbulb moment and coming up
with a billion dollar idea (ehm, Social Network) and then making it big. In reality, founders often have
to pivot from their original idea multiple times before finding product/market fit. In the startup canon
it is furthermore often emphasized that it isn’t the ideas themselves but their execution that ultimately
matters – and this hinges on the early team’s ability to work together to realize their vision.
Likewise to founder traits there’s a slew of desirable team attributes to choose from. Often-cited
characteristics of successful teams are things like: complementary strengths and weaknesses, having a
generally diverse team, and joint commitment to the company vision.

Past experience: VCs will also often look at your early team’s past experiences. This means not only
work experience that would give the founders readiness to tackle their chosen problem, but also
achievements that showcase outstanding abilities or a ‘hacker mentality’.

Founder-market fit. While there’s a lot of talk about product-market fit, in the early stages it is
particularly founder-market fit (FMF) that can make the difference. FMF refers to the founders having
a deep understanding of their chosen market, and a high level of personal motivation bordering on
obsession to solve their chosen problem in that market. Since ideas aren’t proprietary, investors have
to think if there could be someone better to execute this same idea.



#3: Cap table

A cap table describes the ownership structure of the company – who owns how much of which class
of shares. Investors generally want to see a ‘clean’ cap table. This means having a reasonable amount
of shareholders in the company, and therefore a less complicated ownership structure. As a
consequence, everyone on board is a clear value add, meaning no disproportionately big shares for
advisors or angel investors, and no dragging along founders who’ve left the venture. A clean cap table
also makes communication and voting easier.

All in all, founders should use discretion when choosing who to put on the cap table. Being on the cap
table means that this person has decision-making power. If an investor proves to be a suboptimal fit it
can result in a lot of problems throughout the company journey.

Another important feature investors look for in a cap table is that operational founders have a large
enough share of ownership so that they’re properly incentivized to build the company in the long run.
It’s important that while having to scrape through the tough phases of an early-stage venture founders
are motivated to stay on board for the ride which can last up to ten years or more. In practice, this
usually translates to founders owning at least 50% of total equity by the time the company scales.

#1: Rough idea or problem space

While an idea won’t make it far without a strong team executing it, it’s really difficult to build a
unicorn with a bad idea. In order for a startup idea to be successful and have ‘disruptive potential,’ it
is often said that the founders should either have experienced the problem themselves or have a close
connection to the problem otherwise. This way the founders will be very passionate about solving it
and have the grit to endure the ebbs and flows that come with being a founder. Depending on the idea,
you may need to have some domain expertise.
The organic pull of a problem is very attractive to VCs, and a personal backstory makes for a neat
narrative also in the direction of customers. This doesn’t mean that you can’t get VC funding with
another kind of problem, but you might need to demonstrate a higher level of industry knowledge and
be more convincing on why the problem is important – as well as why you specifically are the team to
solve the problem.

You might also want to have some proof of concept to demonstrate that your idea is worth investing
in. This means that you in some way illustrate that the idea is something that can actually be built;
whether that be through developing a sample or testing it on the market. However, this doesn’t mean
showing that there’s a market demand for your idea, which is where traction comes in.



#2: Early customer traction

Even at the very earliest stage, showcasing initial customer traction in conjunction with your proof of
concept is a big plus. Its purpose is to demonstrate some level of validation for the idea and that you
are building something that people actually need.

Traction can often be measured in revenue, daily active users, or something else depending on the
sector: for example for a deeptech startup this could mean having intellectual property, since a
deeptech startup likely won’t have any users at the seed stage.

Since traction is essentially about validation, it can also be measured through things like focus groups,
industry research, and creating a waiting list, among other things. Some early traction examples
include:

    ●   Revenue run rate
    ●   Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
    ●   Daily active users



#3: Growth

Similarly to traction, growth expectations are partly dependent on the vertical and sector in which
your company is. For example, for B2C companies, the focus is on engagement and retention rather
than recurring revenue. For B2B companies, investors only tend to care about month-on-month
(MoM) growth once you’ve achieved 1M ARR, but if they do care, the desired range tends to fall
between 15 to 25%. In general, success can be showcased in a more liberal selection of ways such as
the number of waitlisted users or signups, unusually low customer acquisition cost (CAC), low churn,
and other factors that play into growth in the longer run.


Market
Total Addressable Market (TAM)
To turn grand visions into reality, there are certain physical limitations. One of the most significant
ones is the size of the total addressable market (TAM), which refers to the maximum size of your
opportunity. For example, Facebook’s TAM is essentially anyone who has access to the internet,
whereas a dog walking application’s TAM is people who own and don’t want to walk their dogs –
significantly smaller.

TAM is the proxy for the size of the opportunity for VCs. Crudely put, the bigger your TAM, the
bigger the potential revenue of your company. VCs need to see that you’re targeting a large enough
market and have a realistic roadmap to seizing a significant share of said market to make their
investment worthwhile. TAM assessments are particularly emphasized in the early stages, where
company financials are nascent or non-existent.

For example, Revolut’s original estimated market size was at $3B – and this was only for its initial
market, the UK. Similarly, Intercom’s original market estimate was $21B. Both companies’ early
pitch decks alongside others can be found here.

Companies with smaller TAMs than Facebook can of course become unicorns, and some of the best
companies have started off in markets that don’t seem to show significant promise at first but grow
incredibly fast. After all, Facebook itself was initially only intended for Harvard students connecting
with one another. Yet even these surprising winners at some point still have to persuade VCs to bet on
them – if the market isn’t showing promise yet, founders need to have a convincing story for why it
eventually will.

Therefore, compared to other attributes VCs look at in the early stage, TAM is a lot more binary – you
either have it or you don’t, even if the justifications for TAM assessments are debatable. Here’s more
info on TAM and how you can calculate it.

Make sure to also take a look at how these attributes may be reflected on your pre-seed pitch deck
here.

VCs’ expectations vary from stage to stage, and the above ones primarily pertain to very early stage
startups raising their first pre-seed, and seed rounds. The difference between pre-seed and seed is that
pre-seed funding is used to demonstrate a market need, whereas seed funding is used to prove a
market fit. This is why Series A is often referred to as the P/M fit round, as it is the first significant
round of financing after P/M fit. These are the earliest, and often the smallest, rounds a company will
raise. The size of a seed round will be determined by how much money the startup needs to reach its
next milestone – which in turn varies between products, geography, and how competitive the market
is among other things.
Overall, founders should also be mindful of the implications of accepting VC funding: once you’ve
shared equity you’re no longer the only person you’re building for. You’ve entered a contract to build
a company that needs to exit as a unicorn within the decade or sooner. This means that your exclusive
focus should be on growth to justify a potential exit.


Who doesn’t fit the VC mold?
There are clearly many companies that don’t fit the bill. The VC model works most optimally for
startups with specific traits, namely those that are massively scalable and capital efficient, can go
through rapid iteration cycles, and have recurring revenues and low marginal costs – which often best
describes software startups.
The types of startups that are less likely to attract VC funding by these metrics are deeptech, service
businesses, and hardware companies. While they may have scalable businesses, their timeline for
scaling isn’t necessarily one that aligns with the VC cycle, their TAM may be too niche/small, or they
rely heavily on labor in scaling. Where these lag, even a brilliant team and idea aren’t necessarily
enough to tip the scales in favor of VCs funding your company.

Another category of companies that aren’t necessarily VC fundable are those that formally meet the
characteristics of a startup but don’t aim for high enough or fast enough growth. For example, a SaaS
business valued at €50M may offer massive financial returns for the founders, but a negligent one for
VCs looking for €1B fund returners.


Naturally, there are also companies in these categories that have been VC funded, such as deeptech
startups like SpaceX, Lilium, Darktrace, and DeepMind, and hardware ones like Nothing, Nest, and
Beats. And of course it’s good to note that tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Intel were also
deeptech startups in their origins and/or had a hardware component like Apple. So while getting to the
top may be riskier, take a longer return on investment for VCs, and require more capital, the upside is
also potentially enormous.

Many VC funds may indeed be industry agnostic – but due to the system overall they are less likely to
invest in, for example, deeptech that can often take longer to commercialize than a software
application. Even so, within the VC system there are certain funds that focus specifically on funding
research-based innovations and hardware such as Fifty Years, Lux Capital, and Obvious Ventures. In
Europe, some prominent funds in this sphere are Pale Blue Dot, Speedinvest, and Norrsken, among
others.


What VCs look for in deeptech and hardware startups in the early
stages
– Steven Jacobs, Venture Partner and CPO at Lakestar

Early indicators
“When investing in deeptech companies, in addition to looking for exceptional founders, we evaluate
the viability, readiness, applicability, and scale that the new technology has. This tells us if the
technology can work, when it will likely be working by, what problems it can be used to solve, and
how big the market is for solving those problems.”

Growth and progress expectations
“Deeptech companies typically do not have smooth growth trajectories like with traditional enterprise
SaaS. The timelines are often determined more by the technology readiness level and the nature of the
the product than they are by simply being a novel deep technology. For example, timelines for a new
hardware sensor may be longer than a new ML algorithm due to supply chain, tooling, and shipping
limitations. What is important is that the company is able to demonstrate significant reductions in risk,
both technical and commercial, in sufficient increments that they will be able to advocate for more
funding to continue making progress.”

Assessing the scale of the opportunity
“To evaluate the scale of the market opportunity, we look for where the novel deep technology
intersects different markets. CRISPR for example can be used for therapeutics, fuels, materials, etc.
We then look at the size of those markets and their rate of growth and determine what the TAM would
be for this new technology. Obviously, any startup should be hyper-focused on one initial use case
where they can be 10x better, but we also want to know that the company can scale broadly and
capture significant value that is commensurate with the risk and capital requirements to develop the
new deep technology. We consider the initial use case a wedge into what should be a very broad and
large market.”

Red flags
“Timing and compound risk are typically the two biggest concerns with deeptech investments. For
many deep technologies the question is when and not if. If there isn’t a strong rationale as to why the
timing to $100M+ revenue is within venture time horizons (5-10 years) then that is a red flag.
Similarly, if the market isn’t large and obvious for a new technology, you have the compound risk of:
#1 the technology working and #2 there being PMF when the technology works. Typically we want to
see a very large, obvious, broad market for a new deep technology to be applied into (vis-a-vis a
product) when it is ready. Venture capital is not designed to fund open ended research. Government
grants are better for that. Venture capital is designed to fund risky business endeavors where the
reward is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the risk. It is hard to close that math when
there is significant compound risk.”


Funding for alternative ventures
Companies that aren’t VC fundable do have other forms of funding – in fact, most startups aren’t even
VC funded. For example these funding sources are available:

Angel investors
Angel investors are individual investors that can provide early-stage capital to startups. Angel
investors range from hobbyists investing small tickets to professionals participating in large VC
rounds. The difference to VC funds is that angels are investing their own money – and are thus
responsible to themselves. An angel investor might be happy with a smaller return on an investment
as they’ll get 100% of the money returned.

Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping means financing the company through other means than outside investments. Often this
means that the founders have other sources of income, financing through debt, sweat equity, or
financing through company revenues. Some famous bootstrapped companies include MailChimp and
Spanx, and for example Infobip and Celonis in Europe.

CVCs
Corporate Venture Capital or corporate venturing refers to the venture arms of big corporations, such
as Google Ventures and Intel Capital. The investments can either be done through a minor stake
similar to a regular VC, or through a venture client model where the startup and corporation in
question work on joint projects funded by the CVC.

Family offices
Family offices help wealthy families invest their money to protect their family wealth. Alongside VC
and angel capital, family offices are one of the three most common funding sources in the early stages.
They work much like VC firms, but without the intermediary LP-GP relationship.

Friends and family
Where founders’ own savings aren’t enough they might resort to friends and family rounds, where the
investor is a founder’s personal connection. These usually take place at the same stages as angel
rounds, but are on average smaller than the latter.

Government grants and subsidies
Many governments have subsidy and grant programs to support startup founders, most often in the
early stages of building.

Revenue-based financing
Somewhat of a hybrid between equity financing and debt financing, revenue-based financing works
through the startup in question paying off a loan they take from an investor with generated revenue.

Venture debt
Venture debt is loan financing designed to provide funding between equity rounds. Its purpose can be
to act as a bridge, but can also for example provide funding for acquisitions.


Fitting the VC mold
The VC model certainly favors some types of companies over others, which means you might have to
target your efforts better and highlight slightly different things to gain funding. On the other hand, if
these goals, timeline, and scale seem unreasonable, VC funding’s probably not your cup of tea. If
that’s the case, you should consider alternative paths for building your company. It’s important to
know what VCs are looking for to not waste your time on a wild goose chase.




How to get a meeting with an investor
Today I want to tell you about a woman named Kathryn Minshew. If her name sounds familiar, it’s
probably because you’ve heard of her company – a job-search and career advice site called The Muse.

Kathryn and her team have raised over $30 million.

But before raising all that capital, Kathryn was rejected... 143 times.

And when I think about how many cold emails she sent just to get 143 meetings, my head starts to
hurt.

So this got me thinking… what can fundraising founders do to increase their chances of getting a
meeting?

I posed that question to the partners at Hustle Fund. Here are 4 things they suggest to increase your
odds of landing a meeting with a VC:


1. Keep it short
Most investors are constantly on the go, checking email on their phone between meetings.

This means they likely won’t have time to read a 5-paragraph essay that outlines your company’s
mission, business model, value prop, fundraising goals, and traction.

Our recommendations:
   ● Include one line about your business
   ● Use a few bullet points to indicate the value prop, current pilots, and/or traction
   ● End with a clear call to action, like “Do you have time for a 15-minute call on Wednesday to
        talk about fundraising?”


2. Get a warm intro
Investors are 93% more likely to take a meeting with someone who has been
recommended to them.

But not everyone has a second-degree connection to an investor. So, how do you make a warm intro
out of thin air?

One tactic is to reach out to one of the investor’s portfolio company CEOs.

Start by introducing yourself to the CEO and asking for their advice on something startup-related (see
#1 for tips on getting a response).

Then, once you’ve developed a relationship with her, ask the CEO for an intro to their investors.

When an investor gets an introduction to an emerging startup from one of their star CEOs, they’re
more likely to take you seriously.


3. Do your research
VCs often tailor their investments around a certain type of business. Their focus could be an industry
(VR vs. marketplaces), founder profile (female founders vs. founders in a specific region), or size
(pre-seed vs. Series A).

Many VCs won’t take the time to respond to emails from startups that aren’t in their sweet spot, let
alone take a meeting with them.

As one investor told me, “I’m far more likely to book a meeting from a cold email that seems like it
could be a good fit for my firm’s mandate than I am to book a meeting from a warm intro to a
company that isn’t a fit.”


4. Reduce Your Red Flags
As VCs, it’s our job to ask the hard questions. To determine (quickly and fairly) whether a company is
promising enough to warrant 45-60 minutes of our time.

We review enough applications to quickly spot red flags in an application -- things that prevent us
from moving forward with a company.

Here are a few common flags that often prevent us from taking a meeting:
   ● If the founder isn’t working on the business full-time
   ● If the revenue model is based entirely on ads
   ● If the team seems distracted with many different opportunities, rather than focused on the core
        business
   ● If we’ve already invested in a similar company
   ● If the company requires a huge amount of capital to be raised before you can take the MVP to
        market
   ● If the valuation is super high
Keep in mind - these "flags" are specific to Hustle Fund.
