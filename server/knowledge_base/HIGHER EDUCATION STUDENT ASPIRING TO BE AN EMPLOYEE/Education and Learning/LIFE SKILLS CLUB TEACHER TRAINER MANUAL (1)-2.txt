FOREWORD
Our curriculum provides a unique mix of theoretical principles and practical
application of these principles to develop students with life, academia and business
skills. The curriculum accounts for various intelligences exhibited by students [Please
note musical intelligence is not incorporated]:
1. Verbal / Linguistic: This focuses on young people who learn by reading: We
incorporate exercises and content that encourages students to read and
interpret information.
2. Logical / Numerical: This focuses on young people who learn using numerical
information or logical statements: We incorporate exercises and content that
encourages the students to infer information from statements or exhibit critical
thinking.
3. Visual / Spatial: This focuses on young people who are artistic or visual learners:
We incorporate exercises and content that encourages the students to learn by
seeing.
4. Bodily / Kinesthetic: This focuses on young people who learn by building or doing:
We incorporate exercises and content that encourages the students to learn by
doing.
5. Interpersonal: This focuses on young people who learn by interacting with others.
We incorporate exercises and content that encourages the students to learn by
working together.
6. Intrapersonal: This focuses on young people who understand their own interests
and goals and learn independent of others: We incorporate exercises and
content that encourages the students to learn by working alone and looking
inward.
The curriculum also exhibits innate differences that can offer clues to students’
abilities and potential careers

Facilitators Note
Why are life skills important?
It is very important to be academically excellent. This will make you eligible to apply for roles
in your career interest and excel in life. Education is Power; however, this is not enough. You

still need to exhibit a mix of skills: ‘Employability & Life Skills’. Employability and life skills are
those skills necessary for getting, keeping and being successful in a job or in the world of
business/enterprise which you cannot be taught in the class room. These are skills that you
need to be aware of and constantly work to build. They are the foundation of your future
building blocks. The career building opportunities will expose you to different career paths
and help you make decisions early about your future and how you want to get there
whether it is to go to university/polytechnic or if it is to learn a vocational skill and start a
business.
The rapid changes in our world require you to be
•

Flexible

•

Adaptable

•

Take initiative

•

Show Interest in constantly learning

•

Leading when necessary

•

Produce something new and useful

•

Be Innovative and creative

•

Have critical thinking abilities

1. Volunteering
2. Self-directed learning
3. Part-time work
4. Clubs and Societies
5. Afterschool programs
6. Sports
7. Leadership roles

Unit Summary
The rest of the life skills club session will
• Take you through these different skills
• Teach you how to develop and sustain these skills
• show you how to support your own learning and education
• Show you how to chart a future path for yourself

Facilitation Method
Brainstorming, Group work, Discussion,
Activity 2.1.1 – Ice Breakers- 10 mins
1. Divide the class into four groups. Tell students that each group will make a certain
noise.
2. The members of the first group will rub their hands together.
3. People in the second group will snap their fingers continuously.
4. Students in the third group will hit their thighs with their hands.
5. Members of the fourth group will stomp their feet.
6. On the count of three, have students begin making the noises until you say stop. After
about 30 seconds, stop the game and ask what the purpose of that exercise was.
7. Ask, “Did we accomplish anything during this activity? Did we have a goal?” Students
should respond negatively to these questions. Point out that they made an effort, but
didn’t accomplish anything. Explain to students that having a goal can help ensure
that they accomplish what is important to them.
8. Tell students that in the next few lessons, they will be discussing goals and the ways in
which goals can help them succeed in life.
Activity 2.1.2 – Why Goals? (15 minutes)
1. Ask students to suggest meanings for the word “goal.” Have a volunteer look up
“goal” in the dictionary and read the definition to the class.

2.

Have the volunteer write the definition on the board. Have students offer their own
definitions, and elicit from them that a goal is something a person wants to
accomplish.
3. Tell students that they are now going to repeat the activity in the starter, but this time
with the goal of making the sound of a rainstorm.
4. Remind each group of its assigned sound.
5. Tell students that when you point to groups one, two, three, and four, in that order,
each group is to begin making its noise and continue doing so.
6. Explain that when you next point, in reverse sequence, to groups four, three, two, and
one, each group will stop making its noise. In other words, point to each group in
succession, so that the noise builds and sounds like a rainstorm.
7. Then reverse the order, so it sounds as if the rain is dying down.
8. Ask students what they accomplished this time. Lead students to recognize that
having a goal helped them focus and make sense out of some seemingly
disconnected activities.
9. Explain to students that having goals for what they want to accomplish in life can
help them stay on track and make sense of the many activities they undertake.
10. See facilitators notes on the importance of goals
Activity 2.1.3 – SMART Goals- 10 mins

●

To develop a personal reading plan

Instructional Materials
Flipchart, Markers, Cardboards, Flash cards

30 minutes
Facilitation Method
Brainstorming, Group work, Discussion, Case study
Facilitator starts the class by

1. Explaining the Importance of Reading Culture

2. Introduces how to develop a personal reading plan
3. Administers activity 4.5.1 to participants
4. Concludes the unit using the conclusion

Importance of Reading Culture
True education does not necessarily take place within the four walls of a classroom
A wise man said, “If you want to hide a treasure from a black man, hide it in a book”.
This is due to the fact that most people have a very poor reading culture
Why Read?
It makes you learn from other people experiences
It improves your vocabulary, reasoning abilities and critical thinking skills
It keeps you current in a changing world
It makes you grow and takes the limit off your progress
Developing Personal Reading Plan
1. Analyse your reading habit
You need to analyse and evaluate your present reading conditions by asking and
answering vital questions:
Do you read at all?
How often do you read?
Do you plan your reading or just read anyhow?
Is what you have been reading beneficial to you?
Is your reading limited to one area or diverse?
2. Create time for reading
To develop a reading culture, you have to schedule time for reading, because it
takes discipline to develop this culture

3. Balance your reading
Know a little about everything. Don’t limit your reading to only one part of life.
4. Respond to your reading
It is not just okay to read a book. Decide to act on and utilize the information you get
from it in a positive way.
5. Know what to read and what not to read
Thousands of books are published and released daily all over the world, and even if
you read one book per day, you can never exhaust all the books on earth.
So, choose what you read. Life is too short to spend on reading junks that are not
beneficial to us.
Quality not quantity: It is not about the number of books you read but how well you
read them
6. Make a 6 monthly trip to the bookstore or library
7. Build / develop your own personal library
If any book is worth reading, then it should be worth buying
Activity 4.5.2 What do you know? (10 Minutes)
Let the students answer the following:
1. What is the capital of Australia?
2. Name 5 countries in Europe and Asia
3. Who is the president of South Africa?
4. Which country does river Niger start from?
5. When did the first military coup in Nigeria happen?
6. Bonny light, Forcados, Qua Ibo, and Brass River are types of what major Nigerian
export commodity?
7. Enugu, Kano Pillars, Heartland, and Lobi Stars are famous Nigerian: Hotels; National
parks; Football clubs; or TV SHOWS?
8. The national animal emblem of Nigeria is an: Elephant; Eagle; Elk; or Earwig?

Conclusion
Communication is both oral and written
Effective communication requires understanding of body language (gestures, eye
contact, posture, uncrossed arms, open stance standing), tone and use of words
Attaining effective communication requires one to challenge oneself constantly

You must engage in activities and opportunities to test your skills
Listening skills complement communication skills – the three cannot be divorced
Observe others, understand individual dynamics when communicating in teams
Practice how to write emails, letters and personal statements
Understand the importance of developing a reading culture
Maintain a personal reading plan

FACILITATOR’S NOTE
ASPECTS OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT
Team Building
When the individuals on a team all know what they are supposed to be doing
and how they are to go about doing it, you give the team a good start on
maximizing performance
Feedback
Providing information to team members about their individual and team
performance always develops the recipient
Understanding and Collaboration
Members of successful teams all work for the same purpose. Consensus,
consistency and agreement are vital for effective teamwork
Participation and Articulating Vision
The vision that motivates and directs a team to reach its goal. It is critical to
provide meaningful opportunities for team members to explore the vision
Managing Conflict

Conflict can be an inevitable consequence of working with other people due to
differences in values, styles and opinions. With respect, understanding and open
dialogue, conflicts can be rid of in teams
Group Roles and Structure
An effective team capitalizes on the natural differences of its members and
maximizes performance by putting the right people in the right roles
Team Member Development
No matter the task assigned to a person, there is almost always room for personal
improvement. Although there is no "I" in "Team" you have to remember, there is no
team without individuals. You have to build and foster the skills in the individuals
that fit the needs of the team
Ethics to Remember
● Respect one another
●

Be sensitive to each other’s differences

Be Disciplined in your team working approach – clarify your values and your
objectives as a team

of seers. Only the Seer can talk to the Runner but Runner can’t talk to the Seer ONLY
the builder
● Builders: Cannot see ‘seer’ and only speaks to the runner using words only. Runner
may not touch or respond to what the Builders are doing. The builder can negotiate
for other materials as required from other builders
This game will teach participants how to work together, bargain/negotiate, problem solve
and communicate effectively

Facilitator’s Note
Debrief Questions:

Facilitator asks students the following questions
1. How did it feel depending on others in the midst of a competition to get the
given task finished?
2. What frustrated you the most during the activity and why?
3. What worked well during the activity?

Unit 5.2: Problem solving
Unit Objectives
•
•

Exploring what problem solving really involves on a personal and team level
Exploring how to apply a structured “IDEAL” approach to problem solving

Instructional Materials
Flipchart, Markers, Cardboards, Flash cards
20 minutes
Facilitation Method
Brainstorming, Group work, Discussion, Case study
Facilitator starts the class by
● Explaining the ideal problem solver and how it relates to other core areas

Facilitator’s Note
The IDEAL Problem Solver
Identify the problem and explain how it can be an opportunity
Define at least three different goals for your problem-solving task
Explore possible strategies and new information that could help accomplish each of
the important goals
Anticipate the outcomes (positive and negative) of different strategies to help you
decide which ones you will act on
Look back and learn (after acting on your strategies, what did you notice about the
problem you identified)

Identify the problem and explain how it can be an opportunity
When you are inside the problem even making the choice to act can be a major
hurdle to overcome
Frame the problem in a context – the size and nature of the problem will vary
depending on the context in which you place it
Define at least three different goals for your problem-solving task
Clear definition represents an important and critical step
Explore possible strategies and new information that could help accomplish each of
the important goals
Use creativity to explore options or structure solutions
Anticipate the outcomes (positive and negative) of different strategies to help you
decide which ones you will act on
Being faced with too many solutions can be daunting
Draft the impacts and consequences of selected solutions – ensure you extrapolate
whether solving one problem through the method chosen may not cause another
problem
Also, check the other potential opportunities that can be realized
Look back and learn (after acting on your strategies, what did you notice about the
problem you identified)
Test your options to validate them
Set milestones on how to test them and how frequently
Measure progress and results
Capture what you have learnt

Unit 5.3: Critical Thinking

Understanding how to face and solve problems with confidence, teamwork, creativity
and critical thinking abilities

•

Learn how to demonstrate the ability to apply critical thinking skills in school activities,
extra-curricular activities and in religious activities e.g. Christian Fellowship, Muslim
Students Society, etc. through cash studies

● Explaining the super star problem solver and how it relates to other core areas
● Followed by explaining the importance of critical thinking
● Administers activity 5.3.1
● Administers activity 5.3.2
● Concludes the unit using conclusion

Facilitator’s Note: Superstar Problem Solver
Critical Thinking Skills &Creative Skills
Not everyone has these two types of skills. So what do such people do? They
collaborate
Teamwork, communication, persuasion and negotiation are thus often key
components in problem-solving

Why is critical thinking so important?
Critical Thinking involves:
1. Questioning information
2. Applying knowledge/information
3. Analysizing information
4. Assessing information
When you become a doctor, no one will ask you what is the treatment for malaria,
rather you will meet a patient that will give you symptoms and you with your

knowledge of what malaria is will decide if the patient actually has malaria based on
the symptoms => You see you are applying knowledge not repeating what you know
This is the same for other careers

Developing critical thinking skills
For everything you hear, ask questions to probe underlying reason or basis for it
What do you mean by _____?
What is your main point?
How does _____ relate to _____?
What do you think is the main issue here?
Would this be an example: _____?
Could you explain that further?
Why do you think that?
What is your knowledge based upon?
Where did you get this idea?
Have you been influenced by anyone? The media? Your peers?
What caused you to feel this way?
You seem to be assuming _____. Do I understand you correctly?
How would other groups of people respond? Why?

Activity 5.3.1 Inference (15 Minutes)
Facilitator asks students to practice the following
1.
2.
3.
4.

All Hausa people are uneducated
Everyone in the North is either Hausa/Fulani
Buhari is the worst president we have ever had, things are so bad!
Corruption is not Nigeria’s problem. It is our leaders

In discussing each statement, consider:
1. How do we know this?
2. Why do you think that? (to the communicator)
3. Why should we believe this?
4. What does it imply or presuppose?

Activity 5.3.2: Lost (10 minutes Discussion3 minutes presentation from 5 groups)
Facilitator either reads out the activity to students or asks them to read it themselves
You are all the crew of a sinking ship. A fire on board has destroyed the radio and from the
rate the water is rising inside the ship you estimate that it will sink in two hours. You did not tell
the authorities of your destination.
It will take about 55 minutes to launch the only boat and it will take 10 minutes for each
person to be lowered into the boat and they can only go one at a time. They can't jump as
the water is shark infested. The nearest land is an uninhabited tropical island 30 km distant.
Your task is to decide as a group which passengers will enter the boat. Everyone onboard
has agreed to abide by your decision. Items held by individuals must stay with the owner;
they cannot be transferred to other people.
Please make any assumptions necessary if further information is required but has not been
provided to the group. Just make sure you note those assumptions.
You should have prepared individually before. You have 20 minutes as a group to decide.

Objective: To use students core values to make tough (ethical) decisions and to see lapses
On March 11, 2002 a fire started in a room on the top floor of the Makkah Intermediate
School No. 31 possibly due to a cigarette. The main gate of the school was locked and the
guard was not at his location so the girls were trapped. When the rescue workers arrived,
members of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice
(CPVPV) prevented them from going in to save the girls due to the girls not being properly
covered, and the CPVPV officials did not want physical contact between the girls and the
rescue workers to prevent any sexual enticement. Hence, the girls were forced to return into
the building to cover themselves properly before the gates are opened. It was found that
none of the girls died from the fire itself, but many were injured from the stampede while
others threw themselves out of the windows. Outline all the stakeholders involved and discuss
their feelings and what you would have done in their place and the consequences

President Buhari has just announced that his government aims to set up a youth task force on
crime. He is working with the IG of police and the Chief Justice of the Federation as he wants
the policies and submissions from the task force be implemented by the Police and Courts.
He has asked each state government to nominate one young person in SS1, 2 or 3 to
represent their state on the youth task force. He is interested in hearing what young people
think about crime and the sanctions for crime. All of you in the class have been nominated
to represent 20 different states in Nigeria. Your first task as a youth task force is to identify 5 of
the worse crimes in Nigeria, what you understand by those crimes, what the methods of
punishment should be and how you seek to implement those forms of punishment. Please
remember to consider the budgetary allocation for implementing the sanctions and forms of
protection and what type of society you aim to build.
You have been living in Umuraghi community in Edo state. You are a community of farmers.
Your community has been ravaged by Fulani Herdsmen who keep coming with their cattle
to destroy your crops. You try to explain to them that they should control their cattle but they
do not understand you as you speak pidgin English and they speak Fulani. They also don’t
understand any form of pidgin English. One day, they come with so many cattle and destroy
all your crops in a difficult planting season. You do not have food to eat in the community
and you have lost your income for the next 3 months. How do you react?

You are Efik by tribe but from Cross River state in Nigeria. Your neighbor is Fulani from
Adamawa. He has never invited you over to his house during fasting or during Sallah yet he
always has guests over. In fact, on Christmas day, you bumped into him on the staircase,
and he greeted you and passed. He did not care to say Merry Christmas. You are told by a
colleague at work that these Fulani people are not nice people. He complains of a similar
neighbor who behaves the same way as your neighbor. He says they do not like to share
anything with people outside of their tribe. You are watching the news and elections are
coming up in your one of the senatorial districts where you live. There are three candidates –
An old Efik man, a young Fulani man who has been living for 20 years in Cross River and a
young Yoruba man. Who do you instinctively vote for?

Concluding Remarks
Different leadership styles find yours via your influencing style
Understand the qualities of a good and bad leader
Put yourself forward in opportunities for leadership roles – leaders are not born, they
are made
Learn to be a leader and a team player – both go hand in hand
Leadership is critical – it will come up whether or not you want to be the president of
Nigeria or a minister; in jobs, if you own your business, in university group assignments
etc.
Early preparation and constant re-assessment is key
Listen to others and respect their feedback
Citizenship is key; it is important to build good citizenship abilities and learn to respect
& tolerate others
